# Authentication and authorization

## Aspects of Authentication
- Strong passwords
- Strong encryption
- Secure communication
- Password storage
- Password recover
- 2 layer verification
- Prevent man-in-the-middle attack

## Using third-party auth providers
- Instead of create our own authentication system, we can use the other auth providers which are more secure, easy to use.

**Pros**
- OAuth handles secure for us
- Easy to register
- Less password for users

**Cons**
- User don't trust your site
    - Keep auth scopes mininal
- Limited internet access (local system)
- Different auth requirements (it's hard to use 2 layers verify)
