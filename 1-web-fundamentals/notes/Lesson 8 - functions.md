# Functions

## Take a break 

### Requirements
- every 2 hours, open browser and play a song

### Solutions
- Wait 2 hours
- Open up browser
- Repeat 

### Abstraction
A good explanation for abstraction. Abstraction allows us to focus on our program by using some functions, and the only things to do is read the documentations

[Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)

### Teach other is a good practice to improve skill
- Teach other friend
- Record the conversation
- Share youtube video on the forum

### Summary
Through "Take a break" project, we learn how to use built-in functions of python such as: `time.ctime()`, `webbrowser.open()`

## Secrete message

### Descriptions
A folder contains 50 photos. Each photo have a name which is combined by 2 parts: number and string.
By removing the number part, we can get the hints.

### Solution
- Step 1: Looping all files in the folder containing images
- Step 2: Get the name of current image
- Step 3: Create new name by removing the number path in current name
- Step 4: Rename current file by new name

### What we leart?
- How to list all the file in a folder
- How to rename a file
- How to read documentations. It's abstraction

### Good introduce to class
Good introduce to class is use functions in different files to do the same thing. => Not the smart way.
Ex. Want to show the info of a movie, we need to create each movie in each module containing the same functions but different only data
