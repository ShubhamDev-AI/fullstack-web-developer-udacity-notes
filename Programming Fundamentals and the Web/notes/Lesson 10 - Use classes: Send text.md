# Use classes - send text

This lesson guides us to create a class for ours

## Send text messages
By using a python's library: Twilio, we can send a message from code to sms

- Step 1: go to https://www.twilio.com to sign up
```
+15712574935
```

- Step 2: Copy the Account Sid and Auth Token to code and run

- Step 3: Get error not support for current location
It's mean Twilio cannot send a message from USA to Vietnam

Anyway, just watch what we can learn from this lesson!
