# Linux filesystem

## The Filesystem Tree
- Files and directories have names ("filenames")
- Filnames can contains any characters except the slash `/`
- When Create filenames with special characters `!$#%^&[]&` need to put them in `'quote'` or `escape`\. E.g: `Great filename!` or `Great\ filename\!`
- Unlike windows Filesystem (multiple roots C, D, E drive), Linux has only one `root` file. Therefore, Linux filesystem has a definition about absolute path.

#### Working directory
- Every program runs on Linux having a working directory.
- `pwd` stand for print working directory
