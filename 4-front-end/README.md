# Front End

## What will we learn?
- Why AJAX?
- Problem of async request: cross-platform request => CORS, JSONP
- Model View Controller
- Library and Framework
    - Model and View never calls each other. They have to communicate through Controller.
    - In some case, binding data from Model to View is quite boring and we don't need to do it again and again. So, some libraries or frameworks are made to solve this problem. It's call `two-way bindings`.
    - Dependency Tracking: Models can depend on other models.
- Do you need to remember all of stuffs?    
    - No, good programmer is the one who makes a good decision not the one remembers all stuffs. If you forget a function in a framework, just look up to the documentation.
- Explore some framework: Knockout.js, Backbone.js (be a detector and a tofu)
- Use Google APIs to make some useful app
